# REINFORCE-Algorithm
Training a Neural Network by Policy Gradient Reinforcement Learning method "REINFORCE" for the task of Cartpole balancing (OpenAI gym environment)

<h2>What I learned:</h2>

- <b>Application of the following Python libraries/packages/API:
  1. Numpy
  2. Matplotlib
  3. Pytorch
  4. Open AI gym

- <b>Implementation of Pytorch NN for Policy gradient method in Reinforcement Learning.
- <b>Plotting Reward vs epoch for illustrating the Learning process of the Deep-Q-Network.
